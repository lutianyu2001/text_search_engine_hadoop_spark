Compile Instruction

Start from the root directory of the program which have "src" and "class" directory
Make sure you create the "class" maually, as javac will not create it for you !
Also make sure the "class" directory be empty, as it will store the compiled file !

Execute the following code:

javac -d "./class/" "./src/com/*.java"
cd ./class/
jar cvfm "../simpIndex.jar" "../src/MANIFEST.MF" "./com/"
cd ../
jar -tf simpIndex.jar
